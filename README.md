## This C# project does the following:


1. Accepts 3 inputs from a user â€“ each corresponding to the length of a given side of a triangle.

2. Validates that each of the 3 inputs is a number. If any of the inputs are not numbers, the program will prompt the user again for a number until it is provided

3. Creates a triangle object using the 3 inputs

4. Checks to see if the triangle is a valid triangle.

5. Classifies the triangle as scalene, isosceles, equilateral, acute, obtuse, or right.

6. Displays a message to the user that provides the classification of the triangle and whether the triangle is valid.

7. Displays a message to the user that provides the three angle measurements (in degrees).

---
## In Progress:

- Create a python script to generate triangle side lengths that match each of the following classifications: scalene, isosceles, equilateral, acute, obtuse, right.

- Export the triangle side lengths and their corresponding classifications to a file.

- Import the triangle side lengths and their corresponding classifications into Program.cs and check to see if the classifications are correct.
